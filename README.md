  " You can set directory path you grep friquently.

  let g:friendlygrep_recursively = 1
  " if you set this option 1, you can grep recursively always without question.
  " The default value is null (ask you recursive option everytime you grep)

  let g:friendlygrep_display_result_in = 'tab'
  " if you set 'tab' for this option, the plugin opens result in newtab.
